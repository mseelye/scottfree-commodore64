"AVAST! Sharks appear t' be circlin' t' ship!"
"I can't, she be bolted t' ship!"
"It be quite heavy, an' I be not wishin' an 'ernia!"
"It be round an t' lid is tighter than a 100 year old clam shell!"
"It be fast tight. I be needin' a jimmyin' bar of some sorts."
"Nnnnngrrr... Using ye cutlass, it creaks then t' top flies off!"
"Fifteen men on a dead man's chest!
Yo-ho-ho an' a bottle o' rum!
Drink and the devil have done for the rest!
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle o' rum!"
"I don't feel much like singin' at t' present!"
"Yoho! ... Arrr, yer special magic hath abandoned me Scott!"
"I be eyein' nothin' special 'ere"
"What yer wantin' me t' sing? P'raps a favourite pirate sea shanty? Singin' always be cheerin' me up in times o' peril a-sea! Yoho!"
"There'll be plenty o'time fer bed once yeh've rescued yer wench! Savvy?"
"Welcome to R (Pron: 'Arrr...')!
. 
I be the Dread (but quite nice on occasion) Pirate Goattybeard on a mission to find treasure wi' me wench Marina. 
. 
We be arrivin' late evenin' at Dead Man's Cove and decide to anchor down n' turn in fer t' night, before t' quest. ZZZzzz..."
"I be already on the mast! P'raps the rum is getting t' me! Arrr..."
"Arrr... she be a mighty fine lookin' craft from ups here!"
"I be seein' a Crows Nest at t' top of that there mast!"
"I be seein' a Crows Nest at t' top of that there mast from t' midships! Arrr..."
"I be eyein' her wi' pride. She be havin' a name:- The Morning Glory! Arrr... A fine lookin' craft!"
"Be it so... SPLASH! ... There be a flurry o' activity in them there depths!"
"What with I be askin'?"
"I be needin' summat a bit longer than a dagger! Fer leverage, savvy?"
"I not be that tired. Besides, we got work t' do!"
"Arrr! Ye be jestin' o' course!"
"Arrr... it be small n' dagger-like!"
"It be all nice n' polished like!"
"S-P-L-A-S-H!!! Curses! Another belly flop!"
"There be a lump o' meat in t' barrel!"
"Even tho' stored in brine, it be a bit green for me likin'! Howe'er ye could ask me after a few days wi'out food!"
"I be havin' no need. I be refreshed after a nights nap. 
Curious it be tho that t' wench not be at m' side!"
"'Tis from that scurvy dog Cap'n Bloodthirsty!
. 
It be readin': 
.
''To me dear nemesis Goattybeard. Thank ye for t' scran, grog, map n' wench! Apologies for the rowin' boat. But I 'ave left some friends for ye outside yer ship!''."
"Nailed t' wall it were. But I have's it now..."
"I be seein' a plank sticking out the rear o' t' ship!"
"P'raps it be better gettin' their attention further from the coastline!"
"I be in me dandy four poster bed in me bedroom at t' stern o' me ship! Silk sheets abound. Arrr, it be nice n' comfy like!"
"They be nice n' crispy clean apart from bein' jus' slept in!"
"They be better off on me bed!"
"Arrr, it be one o' those blizzard lamps."
"It be lit!"
"It be unlit!"
"All be feelin' okay's t' me..."
"T'was all full o' food n' drink yesterday! Now they be bare! I've been pillaged!"
"There be a beach a swimmin' distance east o' here!"
"It be part o' t' ship!"
"Walkin' t' plank is fer uninvited guests only. P'raps jumpin' be in order!"
"I be thinkin' otherwise me hearty, owin' t' fact as those sharks be lookin' hungry!"
"The sharks seem t' be busyin' themselves at front o' t' ship..."
"I be seein' me ship from 'ere..."
"There be no means a gettin' on 'er from 'ere!"
"Shiver Me Timbers!"
"It be on a hoist up and out from t' ship. There be a large hole in t' hull!"
"I can't!
It need t' be lowered first!"
"I be pullin' as 'ard as I can. 
It be not fer pullin'!"
"There be a crankin' n' whirring noise...
Boat lowers t' sea and promptly sinks t' t' depths!
Lever moves back t' original position."
"There be a small click I hears.
Lever again goes back to t' original position."
"Be I pushin' or pullin' t' lever?"
"There be no real point in doin' that me hearty."
"I be only sailin from t' helm on t' poop deck when the ship be fixed! Me wench be good at fixin' sails!"
"I be seein' nothin' through t' telescope that I can't see wi' me own eyes from 'ere!"
"I would if I were carryin' t' infernal contraption!"
"Arrr... I be afraid I haven't got a pocket big enough!"
"I be havin' no desires to do such an accursed thing..."
"I be better off feedin' 'em from t' deck!"
"I not be wantin' ter drop booty 'ere ... it be lost forever t' Davy Jones!"
"I be seein' land t' t' east o' here!"
"I be there already! Ease off o' t' rum!"
"It be a palm tree ... oooh look, there be something carved in the bark ... it reads: 'Johnny Castaway was here'. Arrr..."
"Nnnnggggrrrrr.... I can't, it be well jammed in t' stump o' t' tree."
"He be out fer t' count so he be. Must ha' been me rum. There were plenty o' it! Better be lettin' scurvy dogs lie!"
"As temptin' as it be to run his gizzards through, he be defenceless - so that be against t' pirate code!"
"Arrr... I be findin' t' treasure map!"
"T' stump now be finely chopped. T'was 'ard backbreakin' work it were!"
"T' stump be bone dry and t' fire soon takes wi' a dab o' oil n' a match! T' stump now be burned to a crisp."
"Arrr... there be a book o' matches!"
"T' door opens ... I be briefly seein' t' outside before lettin' go o' t' handle an' it be closin' again."
"It be quite grubby - there be writin' on it - p'raps I be better readin' it!"
"It be lyin' on t' ground all rusty like. I be guessin' it were at one time attached t' tree."
"I can't. It be bolted t' tree."
"It be a perfectly good coconut tree. I be thinkin' ... let it be!"
"I not be fer burnin' owt that still be useful t' people."
"I not be choppin' or sawin' owt that still be growin' or useful t' people."
"A large shark be grabbin' me and takes me down t' t' depths!!!"
"It be lookin' like yer piratin' days be over!"
"I 'ave no desires t' be meetin' Davy Jones afore me time, thank ye!"
"Arrr... off it rolls, down t' hill..."
"Will yer stop yer childish behaviour n' focus upon t' job in hand!"
"Peerin' through t' bars, I see t' wench asleep! Now, how to get 'er out wi'out wakin' t' scallywag Bloodthirsty?!"
"''XYZZY'' ... Arrr... ye black magic be not workin' here me hearty!"
"I be havin' no use of such an 'orrid an pro'bly cursed contraption!"
"Arrr, they be nice n' white curvin' off t' north an' south. Remindin' me 'o Dover they be."
"Arrr... they be cliffs alright! A path seems t' be leadin' up through 'em 'ere..."
"Arrr, they be lovely n' white. As pure as the driven snow."
"Arrr... it be depictin' me ol' faithful parrot Smudge. We be missin' her wi' all our hearts."
"It all appears blue t' me. Apart from somethin' fuzzy in t' yonder. I could be doin' wi' a lookin' device."
"I be eyein' nothin' out t' ordinary..."
"The cliffs be close enough! An' I be havin' no desires to be climbin' 'em an' all..."
"I can be movin' some o' t' small ones but the big fellers are not fer budgin'!
I be feelin' a slight breeze comin' from t' rocks."
"Water seems t' be flowin' gently from behind t' rocks tricklin' down t' sea..."
"Be mindin' if I don't? They jus' be weighin' me down."
"A'ter some artistic endevour, I be eyein' me creation wi' pride!"
"Arrr... it be a fine lookin' craft. Lightweight, strong, carryable, everythin' a good raft should ha' goin' fer it!"
"I be on 'em already me hearty!"
"Arrr... Used to play on rocks by t' briny when I were a lil' scallywag! P'raps I be goin' there? Y' know, to reminisce n' all..."
"I be taught never t' play wi' matches! I better be savin' em for somethin' useful!"
"I be preferrin' not t' be handlin' stuff as dangerous as what it be!"
"T' fuse is lit an' runnin'!!! I better be scarperin'!!!"
"B---O---O---M !!!!!!"
"I be seein' a shaft a way above me."
"I can't be doin' that! It be too far t' reach! Looks like I may be stuck 'ere unless there be another way out!"
"Hmmm... I be smellin' t' sea air from 'ere!"
"The ground be a bit mushy wi' water here..."
"I be diggin' in' t' mush but be not findin' owt!"
"What with I be askin'?"
"Make sure you be carryin' t' goods afore ye be usin' em! Heavens, I can't be doin' it all for ye!"
"There be writin' 'ere, it says: ''Will n' Don be through these parts!''"
"I be thinkin' whoever it were, they should be left t' rest in peace."
"It be a ship o' some kind but wi'out me telescope I be not knowin' whose. P'raps Bloodthirsty's!"
"I can't! There ain't no way I know o' gettin' down there!"
"Arrr... I be seein' out yonder it be Bloodthirsty's ship!"
"That be not the top o' t' list o' me priorities right now!"
"It evades me capture! It seems ter be happy on it's own. I'll be leavin' it alone, me thinks..."
"I not be wishin' to on a nice day such a' this!"
"Better be lettin' sleepin' scurvy dogs lie!!!"
"Nothin' much happens!"
"P'raps you should be carryin' somethin' yer not?"
"It be quite heavy. P'raps if I be pushin' it?"
"I cracks it open an 'as a go. Bleurgh... never was fer likin' coconuts!"
"Arrr... Bloodthirsty be in a sorry drunken state, snorin' rather loudly!"
"The raft appears to be not wantin' ter fit!"
"Fer what yer should be thinkin', pr'aps they be better off where they be... for ease o' constuction n' all!"
"I be gettin' nowhere fast wi' t' saw unless ye be likin' pretty sparks!"
"Usin' t' saw, an in tune wi Bloodthirstys snorin', I be sawing through t' wooden grate in no time at all!"
"There be time fer readin' treasure maps later - rescue t' wench first or I be ne'er hearin' t' last o' it!!!"
"It be a bit dark peerin' in 't depths. P'raps I should be goin' there?"
"Nothin' I have is suitable to get through t' grate or t' smash t' lock!"
"Marina awakes at me arrival, shrieks with pleasure and gives me lots o' hugs and kisses afore she be faintin'! Wenches, huh?!"
"She can't speak, poor lass. She be faint wi' excitement! Looks like I be carryin' 'er n' all!"
"No time fer that! I got ter be rescuin' t' wench!"
"It be tellin' me X marks the spot where the vines grow in t' forest!"
"The raft be holdin' up nicely! It should be keepin' t' sharks at bay!"
"Arrr!!! I be findin' a chest!"
"They be close enough but there seems to be somethin' written there!"
"I not be followin' yer... savvy?"
"I be havin' no key!"
"That be makin' a lot o' noise! Need something quiet like a saw p'raps! I already tried t' cutlass n' dagger - no use!"
"I be at me helm already owin' t' fact that it be on t' poop deck."
"I be climbin' t' rope wi' me wench n' treasure! Arrr... just a normal day in t' life o' a pirate!"
"I be missin'  me wench! I be not hearin' t' last o' it if I were t' leave her marooned!"
"I be missin' me treasure! I can't be leavin' treasure island wi'out treasure! Just think o' t' gossip in t' tavern when we gets back ter Blighty!"
"There must be another way o' boardin' her round abouts...!"
"I be likin' it where it be!"
"Me wench deftly be repairin' t' sails wi' her needle n' thread! I always be wonderin' where she kept stuff like that! I be ne'er findin' it!"
"I be settin' sail wi' me wench n' booty from Treasure Island.
.
As I be leavin' I be spyin' ol' Bloodthirsty hoppin' mad on t' beach.
.
I wonder if that's the last we be seein' o' ol' Bloodthirsty?!"
"Me wench relieves me o' t' treasure (as always!), an' stores it safely."
"It be white n' appears ter be grinnin' at me!"
"Arrr... most times it be a clear blue calm sort o' sea... just the ways I be likin' it!"
"There be way's ter be gettin' t' briny but not that way!"
"I be only like climbin' coconut trees!"
"I not be wantin' ter do that..."
"There be a little fizzle an' it goes out. P'raps I be needin' a dab o' fuel..."
"Avast! Ye have completed yer Adventure! Congratulations me hearty!"
"Unfortunately I be ye, so I be just as knowin' about things a ye be! Savvy?
If ye be really stuck there be a place called Googlie or summat I be hearin' is quite handy wi' gossip!"
"Arrr! It creaks open. There be rubies, emeralds, diamonds, sapphires, gold chains, silver doubloons an' all manner o trinkets! I be closin' t' lid now if yer be pleasin'!"
"Arrr... but how I be askin'?"
"They be ripped alright! Bloodthirsty has done a proper job o' sabotage! I be not goin' anywhere soon!"
"Arrr... me wench have repaired 'em good n' proper! We can be settin' sail again!"
"I be findin' nothin'!"
