"Good morning Mr. Phelps. Your Mission (should you decide to
accept it) is to prevent this automated nuclear reactor
from being destroyed by a saboteur's TIME BOMB!
"
"Nothing happened"
"My bomb detector"
"wails ALARMINGLY!"
"CLICK!"
"I can't do that"
"It appears locked"
"button is now unlocked"
"Blue"
"Yellow"
"There's a Bright flash & I hear something fall to the floor.
I can't see what it is from here though.
"
"*   B O O O O O O O O O M ! * * * * * *"
"The saboteur (who also rewired the security system) is a heart
patient. He plans to SUICIDE with the reactor! He is still loosein the building.
You'll find Security keys & a map in the manila envelope lying
next to the tape player."
"politely beeps...
"
"angrily buzzes...
"
"Strange..."
"Most doors & windows are under automated security control."
"Metallic voice says:"
"`Show authorization please`
"
"`Authorization INSUFFICIENT for access`
"
"The door opens just long enough for me to scurry through."
"I'm on the 2nd floor. Below I see the control room surronding
the reactor core. There's a wide ledge just under the window."
"In this Adventure there's NO score. Either you make it or ...
"
"Tell me with what? Example: `WITH FIST`"
"Be sure I'm carrying it!"
"Recorder goes flying thru the glass landing in the control room.Boy what a MESS!
"
"Click!
Room lights dim and a screen drops from the ceiling.
You hear a hidden projector start."
"The screen illuminates for awhile, but no movie!?"
"The projector stops, the screen rises, and the lights return."
"A movie runs telling about the reactor and its construction
interesting highlights:
 1) Plastic DEFORMS strangely in radiation
 2) Even short exposure to HIGH radiation is LETHAL, so suit up
"
"The radiation did something to my pail!"
"Holding a Radiation Suit"
"doesn't provide much protection for me
 as I fall down retching I hear/FEEL THE BOMB explode!
"
"Welcome to Adventure number 3 `MISSION IMPOSSIBLE`
 by Scott Adams, Dedicated to Maegen Adams.
"
"A business suit"
"I'm WEARING an anti-radiation suit."
"It won't budge!"
"Something won't fit thru the door."
"I turn the knob and push"
"gently on the door"
"hard on the door"
"it opens slightly"
"its closed"
"the water spills on the bomb and"
"the control panel which immediately shorts out triggering
the bomb"
"defuses it! FANTASTIC, You completed an IMPOSSIBLE mission!"
"the water soaks into the floor"
"say again & use a color!"
"I'm looking into the control room. I notice that the door is
 blocked by some debris."
"In the distance you hear a dull thud; as if someone fell or
 dropped something heavy."
"Something fell to the floor."
"its unreadable"
"its still connected"
"Oh Boy...I think I did something..."
"It made an odd sound."
"`TV deactivated`
"
"I don't know where to look"
"Tell me how?"
"Try starting it."
"Maybe I should FRISK him?"
"Its a seamless box with 1 small hole for the red wire."
"TV camera is slow scanning the window area."
"TV camera is powered down.
"
"It seems safe. Shall I sit down?"
"Only help I can think of is to: `Examine everything closely!`
"
"I see nothing special."
"HUH?"
"A minute ago someone ran out of this room! By the way I seem
to be carrying something!
"
"Someone came in the room, he saw me and ran out!"
"I see no one here."
"`Owner of badge is not present!`"
"Hi! Look for Adventure number 4: `VOODOO CASTLE` at your
favorite computer store! (Now back to our current program.)"
"Final countdown starts in"
"turns!"
"Some time passes..."
"There is something written there"
"OW! That HURT! Anyway"
"`ACCEPTED`"
